# React-Django-list-app

This is a simple react app to get the list from the Django backend and add new things to the list.

Therefore, it includes two API endpoints. The React frontend interacts with both of them:
It fetches the list of items on page load.
It allows the user to add new items, which updates the list dynamically.
